# ConDuckt's React Portfolio

## About

This is a new and improved version of the vanilla HTML and CSS portfolio from the start of my bootcamp--now with React and a pup that follows you around!
It's pretty barebones at the moment, but I intened to grow the page in line with my skills and feature new projects as they deploy.

Future work entails refining the dog functionality so its interactivity has more features, as well as updating the contact form to be fully functional.
